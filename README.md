## Features

- Cartoonize images using a combination of OpenCV functions.
- Display original and cartoonized images side by side for comparison.
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook format for demonstration.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/cartoonization-algorithm.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cartoonization-algorithm
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cartoonization_algorithm.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load an image and apply the cartoonization effect.

## Example

The provided Jupyter Notebook includes examples of applying the cartoonization algorithm on various images. You can use any `.jpg` or `.png` image for testing.

Here's a sample of how the output will look:

![Original Image](image.png)

![Cartoonized Image](result.png)

## Dataset

You can use any personal image or download sample images from online sources. The project is designed to work with standard image formats like `.jpg` and `.png`.
